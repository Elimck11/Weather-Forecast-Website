# Weather-Forecast-Website

The Weather Dashboard is a web-based application that allows users to search for the current and forecasted weather conditions for multiple cities. By utilizing the OpenWeather API, the application provides real-time data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather forecasts for the next 5 days. The app also features a search history, so users can revisit previous cities and check the weather conditions again at any time.
